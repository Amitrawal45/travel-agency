            <p class="manakamanapara">
              The Manakamana Temple is located 1,300 metres (4,300 ft) above the sea level in the Kafakdada Hill which sits in the confluence between Trishuli and Marsyangdi[2] in the Sahid Lakhan Rural Municipality in Gorkha, Gandaki Province, Nepal.[3][4][5] It is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and about 94 kilometres (58 mi) from the west of Pokhara.[6] Many mountains can be seen from the hill including the Annapurna II, Lamjung Himal, and Baudha which is part of Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world.By hiking from Anbu Khaireni Rural Municipality it takes about three hours to reach Manakamana which is about 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) away.[2] Alternatively, pilgrims can take the Manakamana Cable Car which was built in 1998 for about US$7.5 million.[7]

It is a two-storey temple and is built in the traditional Nepalese pagoda style, features a ambulatory outside, and spans over 7,659 ropani (3.8930 Square kilometres) of land.According to Nepali legend, Manakamana Temple was built in the 17th century during the reign of two Kings of Gorkha, Ram Shah or Prithvipati Shah.[6][9] The Queen of Gorkha possessed "divine powers" of Manakamana which was only known by the persist Lakhan Thapa.[9][10] One fine day, the king saw his wife in form of Goddess Manakamana, and persist as a lion, after he told her about this the king mysteriously died.Per historical Hindu practice of Sati, the queen sacrificed herself by sitting atop her deceased husband's funeral pyre.[9] Prior to her death, she told Thapa that she would appear again, six months later, a farmer working on the field split a stone which apparently started a stream of blood and milk.[9] After hearing about this, Thapa went to where the stone was located and started to do Hindu tantric rituals which halted the stream.[9]

Later he built a shrine at the same spot so that their wishes can come true, and also the persist of the temple necessity should be the ancestor of Thapa.[9][10] Manakamana is thought to be Champawati, wife of Ram Shah, she reappeared during his son Dambar Shah's reign, and according to other sources indicate that she appeared during the reign of Prithvi Narayan Shah, founder of present-day Nepal.[11] The temple is the holy site of Goddess Bhagawati devi, an incarnation of Lakshmi with Garud as protector.[12] Mana translates as "heart" and "kamana" as "wish" and it is believed that the Bhagwati grants wishes of its devotees.
